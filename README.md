### About the project 
As a former teacher, I understand the importance of having comprehensive and easily accessible resources. While there are many educational websites available, I noticed a significant gap: none of the websites offer all the materials firmly anchored in the Swedish curriculum in an easy and understandble way for the students. 

This project aims to fill that gap by providing a complete set of teaching materials clearly aligned with the Swedish curriculum, ensuring that educators have everything they need to support their teaching objectives effectively. As a new teacher especially, creating new resources takes time. I believe this project would have helped been a great support for me during my time as a teacher.
