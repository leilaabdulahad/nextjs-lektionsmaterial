### About the project 
As a former teacher, I understand the importance of having comprehensive and easily accessible resources. While there are many educational websites available, I noticed a significant gap: none of the websites offer all the materials firmly anchored in the Swedish curriculum. 

This project aims to fill that gap by providing a complete set of teaching materials clearly aligned with the Swedish curriculum, ensuring that educators have everything they need to support their teaching objectives effectively.
